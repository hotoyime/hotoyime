### I am confusion incarnate

Heya! this is kinda a placeholder but here you go:
- I mainly work on a UE5 Horror game that doesnt have a title yet
- Hopefully i can branch out into other coding ventures when i get the oppertunity
- My goal is to work in the games industry to any degree possible, but i can't seem to specilize in any direction
